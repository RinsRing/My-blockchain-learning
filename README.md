# My-blockchain-learning
I will show my learning progress here

---

## My first goal was to realize an ERC20 token

I first wrote a HelloWorld.sol on the remix IDE
but I don't kown anything about solidity.So I learn solidity on CrypoZombies(I don't konw how to link)
this is my first zombie https://share.cryptozombies.io/zh/lesson/1/share/wuw?id=Y3p8NjQ1NDEx

now I have coplete chapter 2's course,this is my achievement:https://share.cryptozombies.io/zh/lesson/2/share/wuw?id=Y3p8NjQ1NDEx

maybe I should go to remix IDE to complete the Helloworld.sol
next I will review what I have leart using markdown format.
the lesson2 code I have comit.
